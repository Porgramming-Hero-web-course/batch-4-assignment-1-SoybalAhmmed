Union Types:
  1. A union type allows a variable to hold one of multiple types 
  2. TypeScript can determine the exact type at runtime. 
  3. Allows multiple types without losing type safety  
  4. Union types avoid unnecessary function overloading and provide flexibility.  
  5. Union types (|) are useful when a value can be one of many types  


  Intersection Types:
   1. An intersection type combines multiple types into one.  
   2. Ensures that the object contains all required properties from both types  
   3. Intersection types (&) are useful when combining multiple types into one
